{"name":"SFBAudioEngine","tagline":"A powerful audio playback engine for Mac OS X and iOS","body":"About SFBAudioEngine\r\n====================\r\n\r\nSFBAudioEngine is a set of C++ classes enabling Mac OS X and iOS applications to easily play audio.  SFBAudioEngine supports the following formats:\r\n\r\n* WAVE\r\n* AIFF\r\n* Apple Lossless\r\n* AAC\r\n* FLAC\r\n* MP3\r\n* WavPack\r\n* Ogg Vorbis\r\n* Ogg Speex\r\n* Ogg Opus\r\n* Musepack (Mac OS X only)\r\n* Monkey's Audio (Mac OS X only)\r\n* True Audio (Mac OS X only)\r\n* All other formats supported natively by Core Audio\r\n\r\nIn addition to playback, SFBAudioEngine supports reading and writing of metadata for most supported formats.\r\n\r\nSFBAudioEngine uses C++11 language and standard library features.  For this reason clang must be used to compile SFBAudioEngine and its dependencies, and clang's libc++ must be used as the C++ standard library.  Any application using SFBAudioEngine must also be compiled with clang and libc++.\r\n\r\nBuilding SFBAudioEngine\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n1. Get the source code: `git clone https://github.com/sbooth/SFBAudioEngine.git`\r\n2. Download the dependencies and unpack in the project's root: http://files.sbooth.org/SFBAudioEngine-dependencies.tar.bz2\r\n3. Open the project and build!\r\n\r\nUsing SFBAudioEngine\r\n====================\r\n\r\nPlaying an audio file is as simple as:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nNSURL *u = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"example.flac\" isDirectory:NO];\r\nSFB::Audio::Player player;\r\nplayer.PlayURL((__bridge CFURLRef)u);\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAll public headers are documented using doxygen.  If you have doxygen installed, you may create a local copy of the documentation by running `doxygen` in SFBAudioEngine's root.  The HTML files will be saved in `doc/html/`.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation is also available online](http://sbooth.github.io/SFBAudioEngine/doc/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
